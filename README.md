### Intra Clusters copycat and experimental exploration of API

I use 2 API keys, one for getting a json log every now and then,
and one for an APP with OAuth, in order the verify that
the user interested is a student at 42


The test server can be used with campus_users.json, change your campus
id and tokens accordingly
